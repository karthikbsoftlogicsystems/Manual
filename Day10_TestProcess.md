Test Process:

Planning, monitoring, and control are integral components of effective software testing, ensuring that testing activities are aligned with project goals.

1. Planning in Software Testing:
    • Defining Objectives: 
Establish clear and measurable testing objectives, aligning them with overall project goals and user requirements.
    • Scope Definition: 
Determine the scope of testing, including what will be tested, what will be excluded, and the level of detail required for different test phases.
    • Strategy and Approach: 
Outline the testing strategy, including types of testing (e.g., functional, performance, security), test levels (e.g., unit, integration, system), and methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).
    • Resource Allocation: 
Identify and allocate necessary resources, including personnel, tools, environments, and budget.
    • Schedule and Milestones: 
Create a detailed testing schedule with defined milestones, dependencies, and timelines.
    • Risk Assessment and Mitigation: 
Identify potential risks to the testing process and develop mitigation strategies.
    • Entry and Exit Criteria: 
Define clear criteria for entering and exiting each test phase.
    • Test Deliverables: 
Specify the expected outputs of the testing process, such as test plans, test cases, defect reports, and summary reports.
2. Monitoring in Software Testing:
    • Progress Tracking: 
Continuously track the progress of testing activities against the planned schedule and milestones.
    • Metrics Collection: 
Gather and analyze relevant test metrics, such as test case execution status, defect discovery rate, defect density, and test coverage.
    • Status Reporting: 
Periodically report on the status of testing to stakeholders, highlighting progress, issues, and risks.
    • Performance Measurement: 
Monitor the performance of the software under test, collecting data on response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
    • Risk Monitoring: 
Continuously monitor identified risks and assess the emergence of new risks.
3. Control in Software Testing:
    • Deviation Management: 
Identify deviations from the test plan and take corrective actions to bring the testing process back on track.
    • Change Management: 
Manage changes to the test plan, scope, or requirements, ensuring proper impact analysis and stakeholder communication.
    • Defect Management: 
Implement a systematic process for logging, tracking, prioritizing, and resolving defects.
    • Resource Adjustment: 
Adjust resource allocation as needed based on monitoring data and changing project requirements.
    • Risk Mitigation Implementation: 
Execute planned risk mitigation strategies and develop new ones for emerging risks.
    • Decision Making: 
Make informed decisions based on monitoring data to optimize the testing process and achieve testing objectives.


Deliverables:

Deliverables in software testing are the tangible outputs created throughout the testing process, including documents, reports, and other artifacts that provide information about the testing efforts and the quality of the software.

Key deliverables include the test plan, test cases, test scripts, test data, defect reports, and various test reports, such as the test summary report, which are shared with stakeholders to ensure requirements are met.  

Before testing
    • Test Strategy: An high-level document outlining the overall approach to testing.
    • Test Plan: A detailed roadmap for the testing process, including scope, objectives, schedule, and resources.
    • Requirement Traceability Matrix: A matrix to ensure that all requirements are covered by test cases.
    • Test Cases: Specific steps to execute to verify a particular feature.
    • Test Scripts: Written scripts, often used for automation, to perform repeatable test cases.
    • Test Data: The data used as input for running the tests.
    • Test Environment Setup: Documentation detailing the configuration of the hardware and software for testing. 
During testing
    • Daily Status Reports: Regular updates on testing progress and any issues encountered.
    • Defect Reports / Incident Reports: Detailed reports on bugs found, including steps to reproduce them.
    • Test Execution Reports: Reports that track the progress of test case execution.
    • Code Coverage Reports: Reports that show the percentage of code that has been exercised by the tests. 
After testing
    • Test Summary Report: A final report summarizing the overall results of the testing effort.
    • Defect Analysis Report: An in-depth analysis of the defects found.
    • User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Results: Feedback from end-users during the final stage of testing.
    • Release Notes: A document that details new features, enhancements, and known issues in the final release.
    • Test Closure Report: A final report that provides a comprehensive analysis of all bugs, their fixes, and the overall quality of the software.
